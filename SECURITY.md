# Security Policy — NeuroCatalyst™ Core

## System Overview

**NeuroCatalyst™ Core** is a multi-engine cognitive architecture providing persistent high-dimensional memory and context conservation for AI entities. This security policy defines the responsible disclosure process, security standards, and legal protections specific to this system.

**Technology Stack:** Cognitive Graph Language™, Certified Ledger Protocol™, Graph Databases, Vector Spaces, Temporal Decay Modeling

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

If you discover a security vulnerability in NeuroCatalyst™ Core, report it exclusively through:

1. **Email:** Send details to **heyhaleybird@gmail.com** with the subject line: `[SECURITY] sENZ5hFx — Vulnerability Report`
2. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting:** Use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the Security tab (if enabled).

### What to Include

- A clear description of the vulnerability and which component is affected
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions or branches
- Potential impact assessment specific to NeuroCatalyst™ Core's functionality
- Any suggested remediation (optional but appreciated)

## Response Timeline

| Action | Timeframe |
|--------|-----------|
| Acknowledgment of report | Within 48 hours |
| Initial assessment and triage | Within 5 business days |
| Patch for critical issues | Within 30 days |
| Patch for non-critical issues | Within 90 days |
| Public disclosure | After patch + minimum 30 days post-deployment |

## Disclosure Policy

- **Strict coordinated disclosure**: Do NOT publicly disclose any vulnerability until an official patch has been released and a minimum of 30 days has passed since the fix was deployed.
- Premature disclosure may result in legal action under applicable IP protection and computer fraud laws.
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless anonymity is requested) once the fix is public.

## Scope — Protected Components

This security policy covers all components of NeuroCatalyst™ Core:

| Component | Security Priority |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Context Stream Engine™** | CRITICAL |
| **Cognitive Graph Language™** | CRITICAL |
| **Temporal Memory™** | HIGH |
| **Personal Media Memory™** | HIGH |
| **CinematicAI™** | MEDIUM |
| **Certified Ledger Protocol™** | MEDIUM |
| **Personal Filter Reality™** | MEDIUM |
| **Axiomatic Engine** | MEDIUM |

### Priority Vulnerability Categories

The following vulnerability types are of particular concern for this system:

- SQL injection and database access control
- Vector store poisoning and embedding manipulation

### Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in third-party services or upstream dependencies (report to respective maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks against the maintainer
- Denial of service attacks against hosted infrastructure
- Issues in forked or mirrored copies not maintained by this project

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release and the default branch (`main` or `master`) receive security updates. Older versions are not supported.

## Security Standards

This project enforces the following security practices:

1. **No secrets in code**: API keys, tokens, passwords, and credentials must NEVER be committed to the repository.
2. **Dependency auditing**: Dependencies are regularly reviewed for known vulnerabilities.
3. **Least privilege**: All automations, workflows, and integrations operate with minimum required permissions.
4. **Branch protection**: The default branch requires pull request reviews before merging.
5. **Signed commits**: Contributors are encouraged to sign commits with GPG keys.
6. **No unauthorized data collection**: This project does not collect, store, or transmit user data without explicit consent.

## Prohibited Actions

The following actions are strictly prohibited and may result in legal action:

- Unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or data
- Exploiting vulnerabilities beyond minimal proof-of-concept demonstration
- Exfiltration, modification, or destruction of data
- Reverse engineering of proprietary algorithms or trade secrets
- Denial of service attacks
- Automated vulnerability scanning without prior written consent
- Social engineering or phishing attacks against maintainers or users

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible security research. If you comply with this policy:

- We will not pursue legal action against you
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

**Safe harbor applies ONLY if:**
- You report exclusively through the channels listed above
- You do not exploit the vulnerability beyond minimal proof-of-concept
- You do not access, modify, or exfiltrate any actual user or system data
- You do not violate any laws in the process
- You allow reasonable time for resolution before any disclosure
